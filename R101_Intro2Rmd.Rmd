## Markdown for formatted text
Markdown is a set of conventions for formatting plain text. You can use markdown to indicate

- bold and italic text
- lists
- headers (e.g., section titles)
- hyperlinks
- and much more 

The conventions of markdown are very unobtrusive, which make Markdown files easy to read. The file below uses several of the most useful markdown conventions.

1. **headers** - Place one or more hashtags at the start of a line that will be a header (or sub-header). For example, # Say Hello to markdown. A single hashtag creates a first level header. Two hashtags, ##, creates a second level header, and so on.

2. **italicized and bold text** - Surround italicized text with asterisks, like this *without realizing it*. Surround bold text with two asterisks, like this **easy to use**.

3. **lists** - Group lines into bullet points that begin with asterisks. Leave a blank line before the first bullet, like this: 

>This is a list
>
 * item 1
 * item 2
 * item 3
>

4. **hyperlinks** - Surround links with brackets, and then provide the link target in parentheses, like this [Github](www.github.com).

## R Markdown

R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. R Markdown files are designed to be used with the `rmarkdown` package. rmarkdown comes installed with the RStudio IDE, but you can acquire your own copy of rmarkdown from CRAN.

### Embed R codes 
An R Markdown document is written in markdown (an easy-to-write plain text format) and contains chunks of embedded R codes, such as

```{r}
#embedding summaries
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
#embedding plots
plot(cars)
```

*****************************

### Embed Other Coding Languages
A less well-known fact about R Markdown is that many other languages are also supported, such as Python, Julia, C++, and SQL. The support comes from the knitr package, which has provided a large number of language engines. 

#### Embed SQL
For example, you can embed SQL codes. The `sql` engine uses the `DBI` package to execute SQL queries, print their results, and optionally assign the results to a data frame. To use the `sql` engine, we will need to first establish a database connection:

```{r}
config_file<-read.csv("config.csv",stringsAsFactors = F)
drv<-RJDBC::JDBC(driverClass="oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver",
                 classPath="/u02/PRVM868/ojdbc6.jar")
url<-paste0("jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:",config_file$database)
conn <- RJDBC::dbConnect(drv=drv,
                         url=url, 
                         user=config_file$username, 
                         password=config_file$password)
```

And then use this connection `conn` within following sql chunks via the `connection` option: 

```{sql, connection=conn, output.var="IDD_PT"}
select * from XSONG.PRVM_IDD_PATIENT_VIEW
```

#### Embed Python
You can embed `python` codes, but will need to install the interfacing package [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) first,

```{r}
pacman::p_load(reticulate)
```

```{python}
x = 'hello, python world!'
print(x.split(' '))
```

## Rendering Report

R Markdown files are the source code for rich, reproducible documents. You can transform an R Markdown file in two ways.

1. **knit** - You can knit the file. The rmarkdown package will call the knitr package. knitr will run each chunk of R code in the document and append the results of the code to the document next to the code chunk. This workflow saves time and facilitates reproducible reports.

2. **convert** - You can convert the file. The rmarkdown package will use the pandoc program to transform the file into a new format. For example, you can convert your .Rmd file into an *HTML*, *PDF*, or *Microsoft Word* file. You can even turn the file into an HTML5 or PDF slideshow. rmarkdown will preserve the text, code results, and formatting contained in your original .Rmd file.
